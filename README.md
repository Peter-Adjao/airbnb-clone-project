### **Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup**
Identifying design properties such as **color styles, typography, and layout** from a mockup ensures:
- **Consistency** across all UI components, creating a unified brand experience.
- **Efficient development**, as developers can directly reference predefined styles without guesswork.
- **Accurate implementation** of the designer‚Äôs vision, reducing back-and-forth revisions.
- **Better scalability**, since reusable styles make it easier to maintain and update the UI.
- **Improved accessibility**, as proper color contrast and readable font sizes can be incorporated from the start.

### **Importance of a User-Friendly Design**
In the competitive accommodation booking market, **user experience is a key differentiator**. A user-friendly design:
- **Reduces friction** during the booking process, encouraging users to complete their reservations.
- **Improves conversion rates** by providing a clear, easy-to-navigate interface.
